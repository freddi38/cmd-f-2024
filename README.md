## Girls Gone Running
## By Freddi and Sabrina

Community building track: form a community of female runners who can run (or walk) together to build friendships, maintain fitness motivation, and keep each other safe in public spaces.

This application has a database of users with statistics for each user such as average run time, average speed, common route locations, and common run times. Each user can then see a list of users with similar habits that they can chat with to coordinate runs or walks to go on together. A user can also send a notification to nearby users when starting a run to invite other users to join them.

It uses HTML and Express.js, handles Strava API, and connects to a database using MongoDB.
